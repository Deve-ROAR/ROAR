            Let's learn C with easy explanations, and there are some examples here for you so that you can have a better understanding.<br><br>

            Before we get into the Process , we need a compailer to work on so click on this <button class="downbut">download</button> and download the compailer.
            <br><br>


            Let's start learning by knowing some syntax like <span ><u>&#60;stdio.h&#62; </u> and <u>&#60;conio.h&#62;.</u></span><br>
                In this, we use stdio.h in C because this header file imports different variables, macros, and functions to perform input and output operations. To perform input and output operations in our C programs<br><br>  Conio.h is the console input output.
                
                and It is a header file used in C and C++, and it includes inbuilt functions like <span><u>getch()</u></span> and <span><u>clrscr()</u></span>. It stands for console input or output.<br><br>
                
                Let's end the theoretical part with <span><u>void main()</u></span>. The main is the entry point of execution and a reference to an empty data type.
                <br><br>

                Let's start a section by learing output and input and followed by some arithmetic operations  which will help you understand.
